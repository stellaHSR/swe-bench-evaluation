## [1.0.0] - 10/9/2023

Introducing the initial release of SWE-Bench, a novel benchmark that introduces "software engineering as a task". Given a codebase and an issue, a model is tasked with writing a `.patch` file that addresses the desired changes.

Please view the `README.md` for information on how to run the repository, and check out our paper, [SWE-bench: Can Language Models Resolve Real-World GitHub Issues?](http://swe-bench.github.io/paper.pdf), for full details on the project.

We will maintain a leaderboard on the SWE-bench public [website](http://swe-bench.github.io). We will release details soon on how to submit your generations for evaluation to be included on the leaderboard.
